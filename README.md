## NodeJS API that is connected with SQL Server.
Node API was used for React Native To-Do app.
IP was used http://192.168.43.238:3000/ which is the IP of my development machine.
(In your case your development machine laptop/desktop IP will be).
Both your development machine and your mobile device must be connected in same LAN network.
Before using node api endpoint's, we need to check whether this above IP can be reachable or accessible from our mobile device in which our expo app is working and creating UI. All the data post & get from database via those api endpoints will be done through the expo app.
